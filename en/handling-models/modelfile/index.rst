Model Files
===========

Robot and environmental object models handled in Choreonoid are typically generated by loading files pre-written as Body items. These files contain descriptions of the model's shape, optical information such as color, joint structure, physical parameters, sensor information, etc., and are called "model files."

Various model file formats have been defined by different robot software systems. Choreonoid currently supports the following formats as standard:

* Body format model files (Body files)
* Unified Robotics Description Format model files (URDF files)
* OpenHRP format model files

In the current version of Choreonoid, the Body format is the standard model file format, so please use this format unless there is a specific reason not to.

.. Choreonoid is designed to allow adding import functionality for other model file formats through plugins. We would like to support other widely used formats in addition to OpenHRP in the future. As part of this effort, we have currently implemented a loading function for the "Collada Robot Extensions" format. However, this implementation is not yet complete and may not load properly in some cases, so for now, please use the OpenHRP format unless there is a special reason not to.
