Body File Reference Manual
===========================

Overview
--------

This is a reference manual for Choreonoid's standard Body format model files (Body files).

Model File Conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each model file describes one model of a robot or environment.
The file extension should be ".body" to distinguish it from regular YAML format files (".yaml").

.. _body-file-reference-key-style:

Key Notation Style
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regarding the notation style of keys in YAML files used in Choreonoid, we have traditionally used "lowerCamelCase" but are gradually switching to "snake_case". However, the transition is not complete, and some keys are still in camelCase. Therefore, YAML files used in Choreonoid may contain a mixture of camelCase and snake_case. This also applies to Body files.

In this manual, keys that have been migrated to snake_case are written in snake_case. For keys that were previously defined in camelCase, the latest version can still read keys in the old format to maintain compatibility. However, this compatibility measure may be discontinued in the future, so please use the new format when creating new files.

Angle Units
~~~~~~~~~~~

Basically, the degree unit is used. For details, please refer to the "angle_unit" item in :ref:`body-file-reference-header`.

YAML Syntax
-----------

For YAML syntax, please refer to `The Official YAML Web Site <https://yaml.org>`_.

Node List
---------

The following nodes are defined, and models are created by combining instances of these nodes.
In the actual model definition part, these nodes are combined to create hierarchical structures, thereby creating models.

The following nodes are defined for link structure and dynamics/mechanism parameters:

* :ref:`body-file-reference-link-node`
* :ref:`body-file-reference-rigid-body-node`
* :ref:`body-file-reference-transform-node`

The following nodes are defined for link shape and appearance:

Nodes for Defining Closed-Link Mechanisms
------------------------------------------

.. _body-file-reference-extra-joint-node:

ExtraJoint Node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ExtraJoint node is a node for adding additional constraints to the body. It defines closed-link mechanisms. It considers that one joint of the closed link is connected by a ball joint and generates a constraint force so that the two links do not separate.

.. note:: The types of constraints realized by this node are currently very limited. Furthermore, the types of supported constraints also depend on the type of simulator item (physics engine).

 * - Field
   - Content
 * - link1_name
   - Joint name receiving the ball joint
 * - link2_name
   - Joint name with the ball joint attached
 * - link1_local_pos
   - Specify the constraint position of link1_name joint in local coordinates of that joint
 * - link2_local_pos
   - Specify the constraint position of link2_name joint in local coordinates of that joint
 * - joint_type
   - Constraint type  ball: fixed at one point  hinge: revolute joint piston: translation (rotation around axis is not constrained)
 * - axis
   - When joint_type is hinge or piston, specify the constraint axis in local coordinates of link1_name link.

This node is described as a list with the key "extra_joints" at the top level of the Body file.     
There is a closed-link mechanism sample at "share/model/misc/ClosedLinkSample.body".


Nodes for Grouping Nodes
-------------------------

.. _body-file-reference-group-node:

Group Node
~~~~~~~~~~

Used to group some nodes.

.. list-table:: Group Node Fields
 :widths: 15,85
 :header-rows: 1
 :align: left

 * - Key
   - Content
 * - name
   - Group name

.. code-block:: yaml

  (Usage example)
  elements:
    - &SUBSYSTEM
      type: Group
      name: SUBSYSTEM
      elements:
        -
          (One element of the group)
        -
          (One element of the group)
         :

By assigning an alias to the group node, when there is the same configuration as SUBSYSTEM in another location, it can be described as:

.. code-block:: yaml

  elements: *SUBSYSTEM
