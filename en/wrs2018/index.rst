World Robot Summit 2018
=======================

At the `World Robot Summit (WRS) <http://worldrobotsummit.org/>`_ 2018 robot event held in October 2018, robot competitions were also held in virtual environments simulated with Choreonoid. This competition was titled "Tunnel Disaster Response and Recovery Challenge" and was held as one of the competitions in the Infrastructure and Disaster Response category. (WRS hosted the World Robot Challenge (WRC) 2018, a robot competition consisting of four categories in total.)

This document compiles the technical information necessary for participating in this competition. The models and simulation settings required for the competition are included as Choreonoid samples, allowing even those who did not participate in the competition to try them out. These serve as valuable samples for learning practical applications of Choreonoid.
