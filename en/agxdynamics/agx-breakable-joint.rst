AGXBreakableJoint
=================

AGXBreakableJoint is a joint using AGX Dynamics that breaks (becomes disabled) when certain conditions are met.
The implementation uses Hinge, Prismatic, and LockJoint from AGX Dynamics.

Sample
------

Let's explain how to use this with a sample. The sample project is located at:
By operating DoubleArm to grasp and pull the door, you can see the hinge constraint disappear and the door come off.

* Body file: chorenoid/sample/AGXDynamics/agxBreakableJoint.body


Break Conditions
----------------

As explained at the beginning, AGXBreakableJoint triggers breaking when certain conditions are met.
There are two types of conditions, specified by the breakType parameter.

* **When receiving force above a certain level for a certain period of time (breakType: force)**

* **When the received impulse exceeds a threshold (breakType: impulse)**

.. image:: images/breakable_joint_breaklimitimpulse.png

breakType should be chosen based on how force is applied.
For example, in :ref:`a scene where a hinged door is removed <agx_breaking_door>`, force is appropriate.
On the other hand, for objects that receive periodic impacts from a drill, it's difficult to continuously receive force above a certain level, so impulse is appropriate.

Syntax
------

AGXBreakableJoint is written and used as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

  links:
    -
      name: Door
      parent: PillarL
      jointType: free
      elements:
        -
          type: AGXBreakableJointDevice
          link1Name: PillarL
          link2Name: Door
          jointType: revolute
          jointRange: [ 0, 180 ]
          position: [ 0, 0, 0 ]
          jointAxis: [ 0, 0, 1 ]
          jointCompliance: 1e-6
          breakType: force
          period: 3.0                 # For 3 seconds or more
          breakLimitForce: 3000       # Apply force of 3000N or more
          validAxis: [0, 1, 0]        # In Y-axis direction to break

1. Set the links to connect with AGXBreakableJoint in linkName
2. Set the joint type in jointType
3. Set the joint position and axis in position and jointAxis
4. Set the break type in breakType

  * For breakType: force, set breakLimitForce and period
  * For breakType: impulse, set breakLimitImpulse

5. Optionally set spring stiffness and damping in jointCompliance and jointSpookDamping
6. Optionally set validAxis. validAxis can specify which axes of the joint to use for breakLimit calculation. For example, in the figure below, setting validAxis to [0, 1, 0] means that forces applied in the XZ-axis directions are not considered.
