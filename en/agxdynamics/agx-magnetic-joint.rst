AGXMagneticJoint
===========================

| AGX Magnetic Joint is a joint that behaves like a magnet using AGX Dynamics.
| For implementation lock joint of AGX Dynamics is used.

Sample
------------

The sample is below.
When loading the sample project with Choreonoid and running the simulation, you can see the blue object stick together with the red object automatically (see above figure).

* project file: chorenoid/sample/AGXDynamics/agxMagneticJoint.cnoid
* body file:    chorenoid/sample/AGXDynamics/agxMagneticJoint.body


How to write
---------------

AGX Magnetic Joint can be described and used as follows.


.. code-block:: yaml

  links:
    -
      name: Plug
      elements:
        -
          type: AGXMagneticJointDevice
          link1Name: Socket
          link2Name: Plug
          position1: [ 0, 0.25, 0 ]
          position2: [ 0, 0, -0.05 ]
          connectAxis1: [ 0, 1, 0 ]
          connectAxis2: [ 0, 0, 1 ]
          jointCompliance: 1e-6
          jointSpookDamping: 1.0
          validDistance: 1.0
          validAngle: 20

#. Set the links to connect with AGXMagneticJoint in linkName

#. Set which part of the link to connect in position and connectAxis

#. Set the force and speed of connection in jointCompliance and jointSpookDamping

#. Set the distance and angle at which connection becomes valid in validDistance and validAngle

position is the relative position from the link coordinate system, and connectAxis is the connection direction of the joint.
For example, if you set each connectAxis to different directions as shown in the left figure below, the connection is made so that each connectAxis aligns.
