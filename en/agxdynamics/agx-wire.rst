Features of AGXWire
--------------------------------

* **Hard to be torn**

  Even if the wire is pulled with a strong force it is hard to be torn. For example, it is useful for hanging a container with a crane wire.

* **Good performance for long length**

  | A general physics engine expresses cables and wires by connecting rigid bodies with a shape such as a capsule and a cylinder with joints.
  | Therefore, as the number of rigid bodies increases, the amount of computation increases, and finally the calculation is not completed within real time.
  | In this model, the number of elements can be automatically increased / decreased during the simulation.
  | This can be reduce computation amount of the simulation.

.. note::
  | AGXWire emphasizes speed. The stability of collision response is not high.
  | It does not correspond to a tough scene such as a robot stepping on wires or sandwiching wires with a door.
  | In such a situation wire may oscillate and in the worst case the simulation may stop.

1. Add AGXWireDevice to the elements part of arbitrary link
2. Set parameters of the wire

  * Set the radius of the wire to the parameter **radius**
  * Set the resolution of the wire to the parameter **resolutionPerUnitLength**
  * Set enable or disable collision between wires, links and other environments to **collsion**
  * Set enable or disable self collision between the wire and the links which has the wire to **selfCollision**
  * Set the material of the wire to **materialName**. Check the reference :doc:`agx-material`.
  * It is recommend to use the material file. Though, you can set parameters such as wireYoungsModulusStretch directly into the body file.
3. In order to pull out the wire from the winch, set the following

  * Set the link name, which to be used as a winch, to **linkName**. You can specify any link.
  * Set the pulled out position of the wire to **position** relative from the link coordinate of the link
  * Set the pulled out direction of the wire to **normal**  relative from the link coordinate of the link
  * Set the length of the wire which stock into the winch to **pulledInLength**
  * Set the required force to pull out the wire from the winch or put in to **haulForceRange**
4. Next, use the Node hash to route the wire in space
  1. Wires can be routed in three ways. The way of routing is specified as **type**:

    * type: free     Route the wire to the specified position. Not fixed.
    * type: fixed    Fix the wire at the specified position. The fixed point can rotate freely(balljoint).
    * type: link     Connect the wire to the link. The connecting point has twisting stiffness and bending stiffness.
  2. Set the **linkName** in which coordinate system to route the wire

    * When the link exist in which name is the linkName: Link coordinate
    * When the linkName is empty or not exist link: World coordinate
  3. Set the routing position to **position**

Collision settings of the wire
-------------------------------------

.. image:: images/wire-collision.png

| As explained in :ref:`agx_wire_feature`, agxWire does not correspond to the case such as the robot stepping on wires.
| However, it is difficult to operate the robot avoiding such a case.
| Here are some countermeasures.

Disable collision with the specified link with the wire
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As shown in the above left figure, disable collision between the wire and the specified link.
This can be done by setting excludeLinksWireCollision of the collision setting of :doc:`agx-body`.

.. code-block:: yaml

  collisionDetection:
    excludeLinksWireCollision: [ linkQ, linkR, ... ]

Attach a wire guard to the link to avoid collision with the wire
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another way is to attach a guard to the link which you want to avoid collision with the wire as shown in the above right figure.
This can be realized by describing it in the body file as follows.
Add a guard link to the body file.
However, since it will cause collision with other links and self collision as it is, set excludeLinksDynamic and disable collision between links.
Then the guard link will collide with the wire only.

.. code-block:: yaml

            type: Shape
            geometry: { type: Box, size: [ 2.1, 1.5, 0.5 ] }

  collisionDetection:
    excludeLinksDynamic: [ WIRE_GUARD_L, WIRE_GUARD_R ]
