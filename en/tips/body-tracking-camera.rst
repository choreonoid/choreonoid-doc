How to use the body tracking camera
===================================

The body tracking camera is a camera that moves together with the motion of the robot. When you select this camera for rendering the scene view during simulation, the camera moves according to the movement of the robot, so it will show you a display that follows the robot. Here, we will explain how to use this camera.

Creating a body tracking camera item
------------------------------------

From the menu, select **File** - **New** - **BodyTrackingCamera** to create BodyTrackingCameraItem and place BodyTrakingCameraItem as a small item of the BodyItem of the robot you want to follow. Name the item so that it can be distinguished from other cameras. Also, put a check mark next to the item.

Selecting a body tracking camera
--------------------------------

When you check an item, the camera with the name you attached earlier will be displayed in **Rendering camera selection combo** in the scene bar, so select it. For details on selecting the camera in the scene view, see the  :ref:`basics_sceneview_change_camera` section.

The camera in the scene view has probably been switched. Adjust the viewpoint using the mouse. For example, let's move the viewpoint directly above the robot as shown in the following figure. For details on how to adjust the viewpoint, please see the   :ref:`basics_sceneview_viewpoint`  section.

Launch the simulation. Even when the robot moves, it is displayed as if you are watching from directly above the robot.

If **Keep relative attitude** is set to **true** in the BodyTrackingCameraItem property, in addition to the relative position of the viewpoint with respect to the robot, the relative posture is also kept constant.
