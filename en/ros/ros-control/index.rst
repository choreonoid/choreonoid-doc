ros_control Integration Tank Tutorial
=====================================

This tutorial explains how to subscribe to sensor information and how to control the "Tank" model through "ros_control", using the "Tank" model which is one of Choreonoid's sample models. The "Tank" model refers to the model described in the tutorial based on Choreonoid's basic functions: ":doc:`../../simulation/tank-tutorial/index`". If you are interested in cases without using ROS, please refer to that tutorial as well.

The ROS version is assumed to be melodic as of June 26, 2020.
ROS2 is not supported as of June 26, 2020.

This tutorial explains environment setup and execution methods.
For environment setup, if you don't need the "Tank" model, please return to ":doc:`../index`" and read the items in order from the top.
