ROS Tank Tutorial
=================

This tutorial explains how to perform input/output using ROS in simulations with the "Tank" model, one of Choreonoid's sample models. This is a ROS-oriented extension of the :doc:`../../simulation/tank-tutorial/index`, which is based on Choreonoid's basic functionality. Throughout this tutorial, we'll reference relevant pages from the basic tutorial as needed. If you haven't yet mastered the basics of simulation with Choreonoid, we recommend first completing the basic :doc:`../../simulation/tank-tutorial/index` before proceeding with this tutorial.

This tutorial uses C++ for implementing control programs and utilizes ROS functionality through the `roscpp library <http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp>`_. By mastering this approach, you'll be able to leverage various ROS features and resources through coding with the roscpp library. For details about the roscpp library, please refer to the roscpp manual and related documentation separately.
