Tank Tutorial
=============

In this tutorial, we will create a simulation to operate the "Tank" model, one of Choreonoid's sample models, using a gamepad (joystick). The tutorial consists of 6 stages from Step 1 to Step 6, and by executing these in order, you can learn specifically how to implement basic simulations.

This tutorial is written assuming execution on Ubuntu Linux, so please proceed on Ubuntu Linux as a basic principle. While the source code itself is valid on other operating systems, the compilation method differs slightly, as with Choreonoid itself.

.. note:: The project and source code files created in this tutorial are stored under "sample/tutorial/Tank" in the Choreonoid source directory.
