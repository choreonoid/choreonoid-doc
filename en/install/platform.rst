Supported Platforms
==================

.. sectionauthor:: 中岡 慎一郎 <s.nakaoka@aist.go.jp>

The latest version of Choreonoid currently supports the following platforms:

* Ubuntu Linux 24.04, 22.04, 20.04 (x64 architecture)
* Windows 11, 10 (x64 architecture)

OpenGL must be available on the platform for use. (It should normally be available on the platforms listed above.)

Operating systems, distributions, versions, and architectures other than those listed above are not officially supported. While they may work if the build process is successful, we cannot guarantee this. Please also note that we cannot guarantee operation on virtual machines.

We plan to continue supporting the latest versions of Ubuntu Linux and Windows in the future.
